Offensive Pentesting

Getting Started
Lets get started with a few easy rooms which will give you practice in the following areas:

Active Reconnaissance
Vulnerability Scanning
Privilege Escalation
Web Application Attacks
Its important to take notes when attacking machines, as you will usually be required to explain the vulnerabilities to both a technical and non technical audience. To get practice, why not take notes or write a blog post for each room you complete?

Advanced Exploitation
Advanced Exploitation
Now you've warmed up, its time for you to dive a little deeper. Complete the following rooms and get practice in:

Vulnerability Scanning
Handling Public Exploits
Password Cracking
Metasploit Framework
Port Redirection
Buffer Overflow Exploitation
Buffer Overflow Exploitation
Buffer overflows are used in many of the exploits that we use against vulnerable services, however most of these are pre-compiled by exploit developers. In this section users will learn the foundations of

Windows buffer overflow vulnerabilities
Basic exploit development
Exploitation of services vulnerable to buffer overflow
Active Directory
Active Directory
Windows Active Directory environments by and large dominate the corporate and governmental world's organizational networking structure. Active Directory allows user and service interaction from machines within the domain, rather than individual workstations. A Domain Controller manages user accounts, services, networking shares, and more. In this section, users will learn about:

Active Directory Basics
Attacking Kerberos
Exploiting a Domain Controller
Post exploitation tasks

Having come this far, these rooms should be a breeze for you to complete.
As TryHackMe releases more content, this pathway is constantly being developed, and so more rooms might be added.
