**Defensive Security Intro - Introducing defensive security and related topics, such as Threat Intelligence, SOC, DFIR, Malware Analysis, and SIEM.
**Careers in Cyber - Learn about the different careers in cyber security.

Introduction to Pentesting:
Understand what a penetration test involves, including testing techniques and methodologies every pentester should know.

**Pentesting Fundamentals - Learn the important ethics and methodologies behind every pentest.
**Principles of Security - Learn the principles of information security that secures data and protects systems from abuse

Introduction to Web Hacking:
Get hands-on, learn about and exploit some of the most popular web application vulnerabilities seen in the industry today.

**Walking An Application - Manually review a web application for security issues using only your browsers developer tools. Hacking with just your browser, no tools or scripts.
**Content Discovery - Learn the various ways of discovering hidden or private content on a webserver that could lead to new vulnerabilities.
**Subdomain Enumeration - Learn the various ways of discovering subdomains to expand your attack surface of a target.
**Authentication Bypass - Learn how to defeat logins and other authentication mechanisms to allow you access to unpermitted areas.
**IDOR - Learn how to find and exploit IDOR vulnerabilities in a web application giving you access to data that you shouldn't have.
**File Inclusion - This room introduces file inclusion vulnerabilities, including Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and directory traversal.
**Intro to SSRF - Learn how to exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, allowing you to access internal server resources.
**Intro to Cross-site Scripting - Learn how to detect and exploit XSS vulnerabilities, giving you control of other visitor's browsers.
**Command Injection - Learn about a vulnerability allowing you to execute commands through a vulnerable app, and its remediations.
**SQL Injection - Learn how to detect and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities
