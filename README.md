# My Certificates Repository

## About Me
My name is **Alayna Ferdarko**, and I have a background in digital forensics and Russian language. I am currently enrolled in the **Systems Administration track** of the Cybersecurity Workforce Career Training (CWCT) program offered by **Ivy Tech Community College and Purdue University**. Here, I am studying to earn my **Security+, CCNA, and CEH certifications**. 

I am a graduate of **Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania** with a **Bachelor of Science in Digital Forensics**, where I also minored in **Russian language**. During my studies, I took elective courses in **malware reverse engineering** and **penetration testing**. I completed my degree in just **three and a half years** as a full-time student while also working part-time off-campus.

When I am not studying in the CWCT program, I **participate in CTF events**, continue learning **foreign languages**, and enjoy **photography, playing guitar and bass, and attending concerts**. I have completed the **2024 Advent of Cyber CTF** hosted by TryHackMe and have worked through multiple learning paths on their platform to further develop my **penetration testing, ethical hacking, and Linux** skills. I also enjoy **writing Python scripts and programs**, which can be found on my **GitHub profile**.
