CompTIA Pentest+
This PenTest+ pathway allows individuals to practice the majority of practical skills required for the CompTIA PenTest+ exam. In this you will learn about

Industry standard penetration testing tools
Identifying and exploiting different network services
Exploiting web applications through todayâ€™s most common vulnerabilities
Understanding Windows active directory and attacking Kerberos
Post exploitation techniques (with Powerview, Bloodhound and Mimikatz)
CompTIA PenTest+ is for cybersecurity professionals tasked with penetration testing and vulnerability management.

Prerequisites

You need to have a basic understanding of fundamental computing principles and have studied the theoretical knowledge in the CompTIA PenTest+ syllabus to complete this pathway.
